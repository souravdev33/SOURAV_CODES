        We don't talk anymore
        We don't talk anymore
        We don't talk anymore
        Like we used to do
        We don't love anymore
        What was all of it for?
        Oh, we don't talk anymore
        Like we used to do

        I just heard you found the one you've been looking
        You've been looking for
        I wish I would have known that wasn't me
        'Cause even after all this time, I still wonder
        Why I can't move on
        Just the way you did so easily
        Don't wanna know
        Kind of dress you're wearing tonight
        If he's holding onto you so tight
        The way I did before

        I overdosed
        Should've known your love was a game
        Now I can't get you out of my brain
        Oh, it's such a shame
        That we don't talk anymore
        We don't talk anymore
        We don't talk anymore
        Like we used to do
        We don't love anymore
        What was all of it for?
